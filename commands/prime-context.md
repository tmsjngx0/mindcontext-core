# Prime Context

Initialize your development session with repository sync and context loading.

**Usage:**
```
/prime-context   # Full session initialization
```

**Session Lifecycle:**
```
prime-context    → Load context (start session)
update-context   → Save context (end session)
```

Invoke the prime-context skill: "prime context", "load context", "sod", "start of day"
